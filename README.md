CVE-2023-25661







	

Cwe-20  
Improper 
Input 
validation	

Input validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs to ensure they are safe for processing. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker can craft inputs that are unexpected, leading to unintended input being processed, resulting in altered control flow, resource control, or code execution. Input validation can be applied to raw data and metadata. Properties that need validation include size, type, syntax, consistency, conformance to rules, and more. Errors in deriving properties contribute to improper validation. Distinctions between input validation and output escaping are important
